# Contributing to this project

Please ensure your contribution adheres to the following guidelines:

 - Submitting a contribution indicates you have agreed to the [fiduciary license agreement](https://github.com/cschneid-the-elder/mapa/blob/master/FLA.md) which protects both Us and You from bad actors
 - Be sure to abide by the [code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/)
 - Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
 - Please keep contributions to those created by humans and not generated by "AI" coding assistants.  This is not to say you cannot generate code, if you look at the CICS and DLI sections you will see the grammars are generated from bespoke format text files.  I prefer to avoid copyright difficulties which may result from the questionable provenance of LLM training datasets.
